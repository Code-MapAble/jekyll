*Programming Historian* publishes novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate research and teaching. The managing editor for *Programming Historian* in English is a voluntary leadership role which comes with it the ultimate authority for the publication. All editors report directly to the managing editor, who has the executive power to accept or reject any paper, and to intervene as they see appropriate in the peer review of any lesson under their remit.
